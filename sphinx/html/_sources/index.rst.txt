Welcome to ISCE's python documentation!
=======================================

ISCE's Python interface is built as two separate layers:

1. Pyre interface for user-facing workflows
2. Cython interface for interaction with C++ code


The Pyre interface uses the Cython interface to control the behavior of underlying C++ modules as part of coordinated workflows
